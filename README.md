## Overview

This is a SASS Boilerplate using opinionated Architecture by [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es) called **The 7-1 pattern** :7 folders, 1 file. Basically, you have all your partials stuffed into 7 different folders, and a single file at the root level (usually named **style.scss**) which imports them all to be compiled into a CSS stylesheet.

- base/
- components/
- layout/
- pages/
- themes/
- abstracts/
- vendors/

And of course:

- style.scss

You can read more about this architecture in [here](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture).
